### Objective

Using TypeScript and React build out a URL shortening web app, integrate with the [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs).


You should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   Shorten any valid URL
-   See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
-   Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty

-   **TypeScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
